BRB, LOL, TTYL, these are all common terms found on most people, specifically teens, cell phones these days. Slowly but surely more and more Americans are turning to rapid-fire forms of communication, and they are creating new words and abbreviations such as those previously mentioned. So then are these quick “butcherings” of the English language having a positive or negative impact on peoples writing skills? I believe so, however only to a certain extent. Texting and speaking are two different things whereas one doesn’t necessarily display one’s literacy but the other definitely does. In my own personal experience, the way someone texts typically doesn’t usually portray how good of a writer someone is. However according to a recent report from Pew Internet and American Life Project, "Writing, Technology and Teens," the vast amount of cell phone text-based abbreviated communications teens use is showing up in more formal writing.
