Now that texting has been introduced to our world, no one talks face to face anymore unless they have to. People hardly ever phone each other anymore to make plans or to say hello. Why would we do that when texting is a lot faster? When people text, there are no emotions to be seen or voices to be heard. Just a white screen with speech bubbles popping up every five seconds. Texting heavily lacks the basics to communicating. There is no speaking, hearing, or seeing the other person. There is no way to tell how the other person is actually feeling. There is no emotion, or excitement like there is when you sit down and have a real face to face conversation. Just your thumbs twiddling away on a small touch screen. Texting is not only a lack of communicating, it is also killing our natural language. Short forms are being used instead of typing the whole word, sentences are not properly formed, and there is no punctuation being used.
